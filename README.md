### To-Do
- [ ] Certain roles can only be mentioned in certain channel
- [ ] Temporary demote members from role based on their actions (abuse of mod power)
  - Ex. moderator member server mutes/deafens another member twice within a minute: *temporarily demote moderator*
  - moderator changes multiple member permissions or channel permissions within a minute: *temporarily demote moderator*
